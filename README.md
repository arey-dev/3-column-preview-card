## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new in this project. I took this project to practice what I already knew. If there's anything new that I tried, it's probably the use of @media element, or media query.

### Continued development

In future projects I wanna focus on:
Responsive web design (Mobile-first workflow, Media Queries)
Typography (Em & Rem units)
CSS Flexbox & Grid
CSS Methodology (BEM)

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - I watched his videdo regarding CSS units. This is a great channel that focuses on CSS.
